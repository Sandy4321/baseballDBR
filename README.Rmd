### This is a concept to apply advanced metrics to the baseball databank (the Lahman database.) It is currently under devlopmment. Additions will be frequent until it is submitted to CRAN.

# Install

* The latest development version from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("keberwein/baseballDBR")
```

# Gathering Data

The `baseballDBR` package requires data that is formatted similar to teh [Baseball Databank](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank) or Sean Lahman's [Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). The `Lahman` package is great source for these data. The package also contains the `get_bbdb()` function, which allows us to download the most up-to-date tables directly from the Chadwick Bureau's GitHub repository. For example, we can easily load the "Batting" table into our R enviornment.

```{r}
get_bbdb(table = "Batting")
head(Batting)
```
