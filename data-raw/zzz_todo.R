# CRAN TODO LIST:

# Clean up Sep.Leauge logic in Woba battingstats function.

# May need to take Lahman depends out of the FIPS functions and make them two stage functions.

# Write Lahnam_names() function. Maybe a convert_names function too, using dplyr::rename

# Remove Lahman package depends.

# Think of new package name.

# Add / write vignettes. use drob's post http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/ Maybe some of those as functions.

# Expand README with database example.

# Add notes MD

# Check the FIP function one last time.

# Check all functions.

# Write tests.
