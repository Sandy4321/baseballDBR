# CRAN TODO LIST:

# Need if NULL error handling in all batting and pitching funcitons.

# May need to take Lahman depends out of the FIPS and WOBA functions and make them two stage functions.

# Write Lahnam_names() function. Maybe a convert_names function too, using dplyr::rename

# Remove Lahman package depends.

# Think of new package name.

# Add / write vignettes.

# Expand README with database example.

# Add notes MD

# Check the FIP function one last time.
