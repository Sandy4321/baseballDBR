# Weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA)

The wRAA metric attempts to establish an average of runs scored by all the players in the league and rate a single player as how many runs, above or below average, that player scored in a given year. The baseline of the metric is zero, so some players may have a negative wRAA.

Despite having all the characteristics of a "counting statistic," wRAA is based on wOBA and the wOBA scale, which rely on linear weights, which utilize linear weights, so wRAA could certainly be considered a predictive metric.

The formula for wRAA is:

$$\frac{wOBA - league wOBA}{wOBA scale} * (AB+BB-IBB+SF+SH+HBP) = PA$$

The multiplier to the right is a formula for plate appearances, which differs from at-bats. For more information on wOBA, league wOBA, and wOBA scale; please see the `wOBA` vignette.
